## Deploy

`main` → [bonfire.observer](https://bonfire.observer) on VPS-01 via webhook-pull.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) tests every push/PR. On a green push to `main`
it POSTs an HMAC-signed, push-shaped payload (`after` = commit SHA) to
`DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL`; VPS-01's `deploy.sh` then pulls that SHA itself. Nothing
is rsync'd or SSH'd from CI. If `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL` / `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
are not set, the notify step warns and exits 0.
